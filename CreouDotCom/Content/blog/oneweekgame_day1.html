        Today I started on my <a href="/blog/oneweekgame">one week game project</a>. This
        is the first update on my progress after a solid day of coding.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm trying to keep the concept as simple as possible to allow me to realistically
        complete the game in my one week deadline. The game is going to be a puzzle based
        on the player moving blocks around to find a path to the exit.</p>

    <p>
        The platform I'm going to be targeting initially is Windows Phone 7, with the potential
        for a PC and XBox version at some point in the future. This is mainly to keep the
        learning curve as low as possible for me as I've already got a fair amount of experience
        with C# and XNA.</p>
    <p>
        As you can see from the screenshots and video so far I've got some basic player
        movement and the behaviour for the blocks working. My first task for tomorrow is
        to code support for different sizes and shapes of blocks, and then to start working
        on the level structure.</p>
    <p>
        It's quite clear my artwork is definitely not going to be up to scratch, so if you
        can draw/animate and want to get involved with this project, <a href="/contact">send
            me an email</a> or give me a call.</p>
