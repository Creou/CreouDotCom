        In this post I'm just going to demonstrate some simple html and css for a button
        with a rollover effect and rounded corners. You can find samples like this all over
        the internet, but this is the standard way I like to do it, and I know it works
        nicely with all the browsers.
    </p>
    <p class="PreviewEnd" />
    <p>
        Start with some simple HTML. Your anchor tag around the outside to cover the whole
        button, and you're going to need three spans inside it to style the three separate
        parts of the button (the left end, the middle bit and the right end).
    </p>
    <pre>   &lt;a href="http://creou.com" class="rolloverButton cIconButton"&gt;
        &lt;span class="left"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="mid"&gt;Button Text&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="right"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;</pre>
    <p>
        You'll notice I've used two classes, one to define that this is a hover button,
        and the second to define the specific type of logo we are going to use on the button.</p>
    <p>
        Next you need some CSS. First we need define the button size. We need a fixed height,
        but we leave the width variable. We use a line-height on the span to keep the text
        vertically centred. You can specify margins that suit you.</p>
    <pre>   .rolloverButton
    {   
        margin: 5px;
        height: 23px;
        display: block;
    }
    .rolloverButton span
    {
        float: left;
        height: 23px;
        line-height: 23px;
    }</pre>
    <p>
        Next we can use the second CSS class to provide the background image.</p>
    <pre>   .arrowButton span
    {
        background: transparent url('linkbutton-combined.png') no-repeat scroll;
        color: white;
    }</pre>
    <p>
        Your image should be composed of your two button states stacked horizontally like
        this. The image must be exactly twice the height of your button and long enough
        to cope with the longest possible content you are going to want to use. If you want
        to take advantage of the transparency on the corners it will need to be a png file.</p>
    <div class="imageContainer noBorder">
        <img src="cssrolloverButton_files/example.png" alt="Example button image" />
    </div>
    <p>
        Now we just need to position the image on each of the spans so the correct part
        is shown. The padding sizes specified here should match the width of the corner
        part of your button image. The padding ensures that the three spans are spaced correctly
        and do no overlap.</p>
    <pre>   .rolloverButton .left
    {
        padding-left: 21px;
        background-position:  left top;
    }
    .rolloverButton .mid
    {
        background-position: -21px 0px;
    }
    .rolloverButton .right
    {
        padding-left: 21px;
        background-position:  right top;
    }</pre>
    <p>
        Finally we need to adjust the image location when the user hovers over the button.</p>
    <pre>   .rolloverButton:hover .left
    {
        background-position: left bottom;
    }
    .rolloverButton:hover .mid
    {
        background-position: -21px bottom;
    }
    .rolloverButton:hover .right
    {
        background-position: right bottom;
    }</pre>
    <p>
        And there you have it, a flexible width rollover button that works in IE, Chrome
        and Firefox. (Remember if your targeting IE6, it doesn't support transparent PNGs,
        so you'll need to make sure your image background matches the background you place
        the button on.)
    </p>
    <a href="http://creou.com" class="rolloverButton arrowButton"><span class="left"></span>
        <span class="mid">Button Text</span> <span class="right"></span></a>
