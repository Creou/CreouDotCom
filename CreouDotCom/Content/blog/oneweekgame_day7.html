    <p>
        This is the final update of my <a href="/blog/oneweekgame">one week game project</a>.
        As promised, today you can download a beta version to try out for yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall it's been a successful week. I've met in the original goal of writing a
        game in 7 days. It might not be a fully polished and ready for release game, but
        it is entirely playable.</p>
    <p class="PreviewEnd" />
    <p>
        The daily updates will stop now, but I'm going to continue to finish the game, I
        need to create some sound effects, improve the menu screens and add some animation
        and transitions. I will be releasing it to the Windows Phone 7 market place over
        the coming weeks. I'll also be exploring the options for PC and XBox versions so
        watch this space.</p>

        Use the mouse to navigate the menus, and the arrow keys to move the player.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Run directly</strong>: <a href="/boxedin_beta/BoxedIn.application">Boxed
            In</a>
            <br />
            If you already have .Net 4 and XNA installed, you can just run the app directly
            from this website. </li>
        <li><strong>Download and run</strong>: <a href="/boxedin_beta/BoxedInSetup.exe">BoxedInSetup.exe</a>
            <br />
            This will install the game and all the prerequisites for you. (You may get a warning
            from your browser that the file appears malicious. This is because I haven't yet
            got a signing certificate for the game. I will have this sorted for any final releases.)
        </li>
        <li><strong>Download and unzip</strong>: <a href="/boxedin_beta/BoxedIn.zip">BoxedIn.Zip</a>
            <br />
            Once unzipped you can run BoxedIn.application to start the game directly from the
            download location, or run BoxedInSetup.exe to install the game and prerequisites.
