        In case you've never heard of it, <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/">Global games jam</a>
        is an annual games programming competition where you have just one weekend to create
        a game. Hosted by hundreds of sites worldwide I've been taking part in the one hosted
        at Birmingham City University.
    </p>

    <p>
        Every year a theme is introduced at the start which you have to incorporate into
        your game. This year the theme is the Ouroboros image of a snake eating it's own
        tail.</p>

        Introduction speeches have been completed and teams have started to form. We've got
        together quite a varied group of people, there are 3 developers and 5 artists of
        various types on the team. We got started by just discussing a few ideas and coming
        up with a concept centring around the idea of two players competing with opposite
        goals of creation and destruction.

        I've been rapidly learning unity to get the basic game running. Our idea has evolved
        into a side scrolling dodge the obstacles game, with a bit of a storyline to fit
        the theme. We have movement and physics going, and are starting to get some art
        assets into the game.

        We've just finished a major team debugging session. We've now got the level loading
        and cycling working. This was a bit of a challenge as we needed to load the terrain
        components and stitch them together in real time while recycling the old ones after
        the player had passed over them.

        Lots of terrain, now actually in the game and ready to start running along. We just
        need a character to do the running.

        We've got several in game effects going now. Lighting has been added. Some neat
        little particle effects. In general the game is going pretty well, but the animators
        are hitting some really problems with exporting their model rigs and animation.
        Everyone seems pretty stumped which could leave us lacking a pretty crucial element.
        I've posted a <a href="http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/23058/animations-in-fbx-exported-from-maya-are-anchored-in-the-wrong-place">
            question on StackExchange</a>, but I'm not particularly hopefully as it seems
        pretty specific.

        We've now been coding for well over 28 hours and the game is coming along really
        nicely, although we're still lacking a name (or at least one that's repeatable).

        The 'Creative crew' have cleared off to 'generate' some audio effects for us, so
        it's time to get down to some serious coding to fix the level generation and get
        all the new art assets and animation into the engine.

    <p>
        We've got to a stage where pretty much everything is in place. The player character
        models and animations have now been added. We've still got a few guys building some
        extra art assets and terrain to add to the variety, but you can check out a <a href="http://youtu.be/VdkqNdqgSaI">
            video of the largely complete game</a>. We've lost quite a few people to sleep
        now, most of the teams are down to just a few members, although ours seems to be
        fairing particularly well.

        It's about time I grabbed a few hours sleep. It's been about over 38 hours of coding
        and 49 hours since I got out of bed on Friday morning before work.

        That's enough sleep. We have a pretty serious issue with the terrain being loaded
        slightly out of sync, so it doesn't line up. After a few hurried reworks we get
        it going properly again.</p>

        Squeezing in the final assets, quick check that everything works (fix the scenery
        object that was behaving like a collectable). Build and start uploading.
