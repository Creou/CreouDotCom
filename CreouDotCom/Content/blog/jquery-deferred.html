    <p>If you've used jQuery, you've probably used a <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/">deferred</a> object. It's what jQuery returns from all it's ajax functions. Did you know that you can also create deferred wrappers around your own code.</p>
    <p class="PreviewEnd" />
    <p>All you have to do is create a new Deferred object, perform your asyncronous code within it, and call resolve when you are finished. You should also return a promise from the deferred object which your calling code can use to synchronise with. (The promise object is just a subset of deferred that prevents external code from mucking with the status of your deferred object)
    <pre>
function doSomethingDeferred() {
    return new $.Deferred(function (deferred) {

        // Do something async.
        .
        .
        .

        // If anything goes wrong, call reject.
        deferred.reject(errorData);

        // When finished, call resolve.
        deferred.resolve(data);

    }).promise(); // Return a promise to complete the deferred.
}</pre>
    <p>
        You might be thinking why would you want to do this. Well the main reason is that you can make use jQuery's <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jquery.when/">$.when()</a> function. The when function takes multiple deferreds (or promises), and wraps them all in a single promise. This means you can combine your deferreds with jQueries inbuilt functions that return promises such as animations or ajax requests.
    </p>
    <pre>
$.when(
    doSomethingDeferred(),
    doSomethingElseDeferred(),
    doAnotherDeferred()
).done(function(somethingResult, somethingElseResult, anotherResult) { 
    // All deferreds are complete.
}
).fail(function () {
    // One of the deferred calls failed.
})
    </pre>
</body>
