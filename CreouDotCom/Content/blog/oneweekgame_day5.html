        This is the day 5 update of my <a href="/blog/oneweekgame">one week game project</a>.
        Almost no code was written today, it was a day of art and design.

        I've finally accepted the fact that I'm going to have to do the artwork for this
        game myself. I spent a large part of the morning drawing and redrawing the level
        tiles until I was happy with them. The problem with my artistic ability is not just
        the significant lack of ability, but also the speed at which I'm able to produce
        anything. It took several attempts and reworks before I was able to produce the
        required set of 16 tiles that fitted together seamlessly in all the possible configurations.
        The new graphics are an attempt to look like a Tron style virtual reality world.

            <img height="200" src="oneweekgame-day5_files/tiles.jpg" alt="Tiles" /></a>
    </div>
    <p>
        To take a break from the art I worked on designs for two new puzzles. It's surprisingly
        difficult to come up with levels that aren't instantly solvable with a single move,
        it's very easy to initially overlook a block that can be moved to allow the player
        straight through to the exit.

    <p>
        I spent a little bit of time in the afternoon looking at <a href="http://www.blender.org/">
            Blender</a>. If all goes to plan I'm hoping to create a 3D model for the player
        character. Don't expect anything complex, but the hope is that by using a 3D model
        rather than the flat tile that is currently being used I will be able to rotate
        it to face the direction of movement.
