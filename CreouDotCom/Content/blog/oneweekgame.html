        I recently finished a contract and rather than immediately starting the search for
        my next client I've decided to take some time off to work on a solo project.
    </p>
    <p class="PreviewEnd" />
    <p>
        To keep motivated and to provide some form of goal I am going to set myself the
        challenge of writing a game from scratch in just one week. I'll be making updates
        here every evening so you can see my progress.
    </p>
    <p>
        My aim is to have a complete game ready by this time next week.

        <li><a href="/blog/oneweekgame-day2">Day 2 - Bigger blocks, collision bugs and level
            loading</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="/blog/oneweekgame-day3">Day 3 - Level select, progress tracking, saving,
            loading and improved block tiling</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="/blog/oneweekgame-day4">Day 4 - More collision bugs, improved level functionality
            and menus</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="/blog/oneweekgame-day5">Day 5 - Art and level design</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="/blog/oneweekgame-day6">Day 6 (the weekend) - 3D rendering and a new puzzle</a>.</li>

    <h3>
        Artists?</h3>
    <p>
        I'm a software guy and my level of art ability just about extends to stick men,
        so if there are any artists out there who fancy getting involved with this challenge
        then please <a href="/contact">send me an email</a> or give me a call. I'm going
        to be using the offices at the Birmingham Science Park at Faraday Wharf for part
        of the week, so if you're local and able to pop in and work on this together that's
        even better.</p>
