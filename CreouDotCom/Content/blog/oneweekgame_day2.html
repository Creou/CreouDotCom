        This is the day 2 update of my <a href="/blog/oneweekgame">one week game project</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main tasks for today were to get the movement behaviour working for blocks of
        different shapes and sizes, and to start work on a level manager.

        At first things started fairly well, I quickly had multiple blocks connected together
        behaving as expected but then I hit a problem. When working on the initial collision
        detection code I had overlooked a bug with the player overlapping the blocks slightly
        during pushing. I had dismissed it as something that would be easy to resolve at
        a later stage. It turns out however that this was much more of a problem than I
        had initially realised. Because of the structure I had used in my collision detection
        each phase was very dependant on the steps before, making the correction of the
        overlap difficult. In the end I decided to completely re-write the collision algorithm
        from scratch. At the time this seemed like a real set back, but after I had chance to
        redesign the code I've been left with a much cleaner flow for the collision detection.

        The second task for the day - the level loading - has gone smoothly. I'm now using
        a simple text file to define each level which means I can construct different designs
        and test the puzzles efficiently. Tomorrow I will need to continue with the level
        manager to extend the support for combined blocks, add in the completion conditions
        and start looking at level switch and selection.
