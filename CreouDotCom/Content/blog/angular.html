	<h1>Learning Angular</h1>

	<p>
		As part of the Conference App that we built recently I was
		tasked with learning how to use Angular.
	</p>

	<p>
		This blog details some of the ups and downs of the learning
		experience.
	</p>

	<p class="PreviewEnd" />

	<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

	<p>
		Having now finished the first phase of the conference app I
		at least know something about Angular, although I’m still far from an expert. Undoubted
		some of the ways that I have accomplished goals could have been done better,
		but this is part of the learning experience.
	</p>

	<p>
		This is not a ‘learn Angular’ blog, it’s a blog about me
		trying to learn Angular.
	</p>



	<p>
		<h2>Prior Knowledge</h2>
		I’ve previously worked on WebAPI projects so I was familiar
		with producing a REST back end. I’ve also worked on ASP.net and WebForms
		projects and felt the pain of trying to understand the .Net page lifecycle and custom
		controls.
	</p>

	<p>
		I’ve not done a great deal of HTML or Javascript as most of
		the projects I’d previously worked on had already existing front end systems in
		place and had never worked on a single page web application.
	</p>



	<p>
		<h2>Why</h2>
		Most of my previous experience has been with server side
		technologies with only minimal front end experience and so I’m pushing myself
		to keep up to date with newer and emerging front end technologies. Simon had
		identified a need for an app to assist conference delegates, therefore this
		seemed like a good excuse to get stuck into learning about a single page app
		framework.
	</p>



	<p>
		<h2>Why Angular</h2>
		There are a number of single page app frameworks that we
		could have chosen like Ember, or Backbone (a comparison of which can be found
		here:  <a href="https://www.airpair.com/js/javascript-framework-comparison">https://www.airpair.com/js/javascript-framework-comparison</a>)
	</p>

	<p>
		As a company we’ve recently been exposed to (the results of)
		Angular on a client project and we were impressed by the results. Also it seems
		like one of the most popular frameworks and possibly the most supported so we
		choose this as our framework of choice for this app.
	</p>



	<p>
		<h2>Conference App</h2>
		The point of the app is to facilitate the experience of
		attending a conference with multiple ‘Tracks’ of discourses that could be
		attended. A user can view the various sessions grouped by either ‘Track’ or by
		time and be presented with list of session titles and times. By clicking on
		those titles they can find out additional information such as room name/number,
		the speaker, and the session description. The user can also choose to leave
		feedback about each session and also about the conference as a whole. This
		feedback comprises some 1-5 star ratings for various aspects and also free text
		for suggestions/comments. The feedback is saved to a database for the
		conference organisers to analyse to improve future events.

	<p>
		<h2>Initial impression.</h2>
		Having previously worked with ASP.net web pages I was
		excited about the (relative/reported) simplicity of the Angular way. Had I had
		experience of some of the other SPA frameworks this may not have been such a
		novelty, but this was the first one I’d had opportunity to use/learn. (If you’ve
		ever done web forms you will understand).
	</p>

	<p>
		I was developing the app in Visual Studio and being a fan of
		Nuget used that to obtain the Angular package. There are some fairly easy to
		follow videos on the Angular web site, although it wasn’t clear from the outset
		how these simple demos would translate to the requirements of my app.
	</p>

	<p>
		This is partially due to it being a web technology but I
		found it initially confusing that there seems to be a fairly large number of
		different ways to achieve the same result without any being obviously more
		correct than others. I also think the Angular website needs some love to make
		it more obvious where the tutorials are.  (They are in the ‘Develop’ toolbar
		menu). I ended up watching 3rd party tutorial videos which may or
		may not have contributed to the ‘many ways to do something’ issue.
	</p>


	<p>
		<h2>Angular Philosophies</h2>
		Angular code is modular with all dependencies injected via
		constructor injection. This makes it very easy to write automated tests for.
		<pre>app.controller('controllerName', function (injected, dependancies, here) {
...code that uses the dependancies...
});
</pre>
	</p>


	<p>
		<h2>Structure</h2>
		The ‘single page’ is constructed in the usual way, either as
		a static page or delivered some other way if required (MVC). The single page
		has a single ‘ng-app’ attribute on the html tag that signifies that this is an angular container.
		Also on the static page there is an element with an ‘ng-view’ attribute. This signifies
		the container for all of the Angular generated content. Additional content can appear outside of this but will not be inserted by Angular.
		<pre>&lt;html lang="en" ng-app="app"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;...&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
	...
	&lt;div id="view" ng-view&gt;&lt;/div&gt;		
&lt;/body&gt;	
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
	</p>
	<h3>Routing</h3>
	<p>
		Navigation between ‘virtual’ pages is via anchor style links
		which are ‘routed’ via a routing engine to specified ‘controllers’ and ‘templates’.
		<pre>app.config(function ($routeProvider, $locationProvider) {
	...
	$routeProvider.when('/byTrack', {
		templateUrl: 'partials/byTrack.html',
		controller: 'ByTrackController'
	});
	$routeProvider.when('/byTime', {
		templateUrl: 'partials/byTime.html',
		controller: 'ByTimeController'
	});
	...
}
</pre><br />
		The routing can load templates via HTTP requests from separate
		files reducing the amount of mark-up that must be loaded on app start-up/page
		load. ‘Templates’ are basically the ‘view’ of MVVM and are Angular compiled HTML files that
		will get inserted into the ng-view container.
	</p>
	<p>
		Links do not have to be within the ng-view container as demonstrated in the conference app by
		a <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar">Bootstrap navbar</a> that sits just above the ng-view container.
		<pre>&lt;div role="navigation"&gt;
	&lt;ul class="nav nav-pills ddd" nav-active-link&gt;
		&lt;li role="presentation"&gt;&lt;a href="#/home"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li role="presentation"&gt;&lt;a href="#/byTrack"&gt;By Track&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li role="presentation"&gt;&lt;a href="#/byTime"&gt;By Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li role="presentation"&gt;&lt;a href="#/eventFeedback"&gt;Feedback&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
	</p>

	<h3>Controllers and views</h3>
	<p>
		Controllers, like other angular components are just JavaScript
		functions. The controller prepares data making it available for binding to the
		view (equivalent to the view-model?). In our conference app the controllers’
		job is typically to make a request from the data layer, and then sort/filter
		the data as required. It is also where event listeners are registered to deal
		with e.g. button clicks and then sending the data back to the data layer.
		<br />In the example below from the conference app the event feed-back controller is fetching the 'company size' values
		<pre>app.controller('EventFeedbackController', function ($scope, ...) {
	...
	$scope.statii = statiiService.query(function (value) {
		var x = value;
	});...
}
</pre><br/>Which are used to populate a drop down combo box bound in the view:<pre>								
&lt;label class="col-xs-7 col-sm-8"&gt;What size company do you work for?&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;div class="col-xs-5 col-sm-4"&gt;
&lt;select ng-model="feedback.CompanySize" class="form-control" ng-disabled="formDisable" ng-options="size.Id as size.Text for size in sizes"&gt;
	&lt;option value=""&gt;Select company size&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
	</p>

	<h3>Directives</h3>
	<p>
		Directives are like code snippets, or partial views. They
		can have their own controller and template. They are also the only part of the
		Angular framework where it is recommended to interact directly with the DOM. In
		the conference app I used a directive to render the sessions in a consistent
		way and to minimise code duplication as various pages needed to render session
		information. They can also be used to modify elements rather than replace them.
		IMHO directives are one of the more complicated bits of Angular with a lot of
		things, some quite complicated, to understand. However some of the more simple
		things can be picked up fairly quickly.
	</p>
	<p>
		Session detail directive from app:
		<pre>		
app.directive('sessionDetail', function () {
	return {
		templateUrl: 'partials/sessionDetail.html',
		restrict: 'E',
		replace: true,
		scope: {
			session: '=data'
		},
		controller: 'SessionDetailController'
	};
});</pre>
	</p>


	<p>
		<h2>Issues</h2>
		Some things can be quite trying, for instance directives are
		supposed to be declared using pascalCase but consumed in hyphenated-format. E.g.
		my session directive was declared as sessionDetail but had to be consumed as
		session-detail. It’s a feature that you <strong><em>can</em></strong>	 do this however I didn’t realise
		at first that it was <strong><em>required</em></strong>. You cannot consume your directives in
		their declared pascalCase, it just doesn’t work. There is actually a page on
		the Angular site that lists some common pitfalls, but personally I think these
		will depend on your programming background. I also had issues with ‘promises’.
		This is possibly due to the various ‘types’ of promises that exist currently
		due to non-universal browser support, but either way promises didn’t seem to
		work as expected in a consistent manner which meant I ended up using call backs
		some of the time.
	</p>


	<p>
		<h2>Awesomeness</h2>
		It’s incredibly easy to knock up a CRUD style application in
		minutes once you’ve got the hang of it with virtually no ‘boilerplate’.
		<br /><a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/creating-crud-app-minutes-angulars-resource/">Example on SitePoint.</a>
	</p>



	<p>
		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		Would I be happy to use Angular again? Yes most definitely.
		Even when you consider technologies like MVC which make CRUD style operations
		easy, if you are going to use Ajax or Javascript at all in your pages then it
		could potentially benefit from Angular.
