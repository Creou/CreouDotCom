        This is the day 6 update of my <a href="/blog/oneweekgame">one week game project</a>.
        It's been a busy weekend and I haven't had much time to do anything towards the
        game, so I'll be counting Sunday as a day of rest and making the final 7th day post
        tomorrow at which point I will be releasing the project as a PC beta version in
        whatever state it is in for people to try out.

        I spent a little time banging my head against the brick wall of 3D rendering, and
        I did manage to get a few moments to plot some more devious levels. Solve this one
        if you can.
