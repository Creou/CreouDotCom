        If you make regular use of Asserts and also write unit tests you might have encountered
        a little problem. If your assert gets triggered during a unit test run the assert
        dialog box is displayed and your test hangs.
    </p>
    <p>
        You could of course just only run your unit tests against release builds so your
        asserts are compiled out, but this doesn't cover the case when you are writing the
        unit test and repeatedly having to dismiss assert dialogs quickly becomes annoying.
        Or trying to encourage your developers to run unit tests before making a checkin.</p>
    <p class="PreviewEnd" />
    <p class="note">
        I also think it's good practise to run your unit tests against your debug build,
        especially during the early stages of a project when you are likely to be giving
        debug builds to QA.</p>
    <p>
        This little library provides two features.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1. It allows you to disable the assert UI so any asserts that are triggered are
            just ignored.</li>
        <li>2. It allows you to automatically have asserts converted to exceptions so you can
            have your test fail if any asserts are triggered.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Both features can enabled either with a static method call in your test classes
        initialize/cleanup methods, or by wrapping a lambda around the specific lines of
        code that you want to re-route the asserts for.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is my typical setup. Within a test class I disable the UI and convert asserts
        to exceptions. This prevents any hangs caused by asserts, and converts them to exceptions
        so the test will fail and you'll get notified of the problem.
    </p>
    <pre>    private static AssertRouter _globalAssertRouter;

    [ClassInitialize()]
    public static void MyClassInitialize(TestContext testContext)
    {
        _globalAssertRouter = new AssertRouter(AssertUIBehaviour.DisableUIAndThrowExceptions);
    }

    [ClassCleanup()]
    public static void MyClassCleanup()
    {
        _globalAssertRouter.Dispose();
    }</pre>
    <p>
        Then within any specific test that I want to permit to trigger an assert:</p>
    <pre>   AssertRouter.Reroute(AssertUIBehaviour.DisableUI, () =>
    {
        // Code that triggers an assert.
    });</pre>
