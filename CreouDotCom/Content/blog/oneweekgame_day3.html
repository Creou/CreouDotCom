    <p>
        This is the day 3 update of my <a href="/blog/oneweekgame">one week game project</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today started with work on the level select menu. This might seem very simple, but
        in order to correctly allow selection of the locked and unlocked levels I also had
        to write the saving and loading system to keep track of player progress. The level
        selection menu will automatically display all the available levels and each time
        a level is completed the next one is unlocked. As part of the level tracking I've
        now also implemented the level completion code.
    </p>

    <div class="imageContainer">

            <img height="100" src="oneweekgame-day3_files/screenshot1.jpg" alt="Screen shot 1" /></a>
    </div>
    <p>
        Once the level selection and tracking was complete I moved on to some improvements
        to the block tiling system. Now the tile loader will detect when a large block is
        composed of multiple small blocks and use appropriate tiles to make the connections
        between blocks smooth. It might be a subtle change, but once I have some real artwork
        in place this will make the blocks more defined and easier to see. You might also
        notice that I've implemented a visual indicator for the level goal.
    </p>

            <img height="200" src="oneweekgame-day3_files/screenshot2.jpg" alt="Screen shot 2" /></a>
        <a href="oneweekgame-day3_files/screenshot3_before.jpg">
            <img height="200" src="oneweekgame-day3_files/screenshot3_before.jpg" alt="Screen shot 3 before" /></a>
        <a href="oneweekgame-day3_files/screenshot3_after.jpg">
            <img height="200" src="oneweekgame-day3_files/screenshot3_after.jpg" alt="Screen shot 3 after" /></a>
    </div>
    <p>
        I've discovered a few bugs that have arisen in the movement behaviour, for example,
        it's possible to catch the player on the side of a combined block and drag it along
        sideways which would defeat the point of many of the puzzle possibilities. Tomorrow
        I will start by resolving some of these handling issues and then perhaps it's time
        to start designing some real levels.</p>
